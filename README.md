### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an ordinary self-taught computer programmer. Programming is something I like most. Itâ€™s fascinating to me.

Also, I am a full-time learner. I am an enthusiastic learner and always enjoy learning something new about technology. I always try to keep update myself by learning.
